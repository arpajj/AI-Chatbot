#  AI-Chatbot project:

#### This is a small application regarding that recommends restaurants to potential customers using information retrieval by a standard small database (type of cuisines, areas etc). For operation (understanding & generation), the AI-Chatbot is based on logic, machine learning and hard-coded rules while processing the input utterances.   

## How to use:

__STEP 1__: Start by cloning the present repository by running: `git clone https://github.com/arpajj/AI-Chatbot.git`.

__STEP 2__: Install all the required packages from the [requirements file](./requirements.txt) by using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

__STEP 3__: If you are only interested to test/talk to the AI-Chatbot you can run the file [chatting.py](./chatting.py), by executing `python chatting.py`. If you do so, you will be asked if you want to chat with the "normal Chatbot" ([Chatbot.py](./Chatbot.py)) or with a "shortened version of the Chatbot" ([Short_Chatbot.py](./Short_Chatbot.py)).  

__STEP 4__: If you are also interested on the statistical analysis on the data that the project used, you can run the notebook [Runner.py](./Runner.ipunb). In the end of this notebook you will be able to start chatting with the two versions of the Chatbot (as in the [chatting.py](./chatting.py) file). There you can also see two examples, one for each version of the Chatbot, of how the conversation between the _User_ and the _System_ is unfolding.

#### __Important Note__: âœ… It's _highly recommended_ that, before trying to talk to the Chatbot, you first explore the original notebok of the project [AI_Chatbot_Final.ipynb](./AI_Chatbot_Final.ipynb). This notebook, which essentially encompasses the whole implementation and the front-end, several examples of conversations are included that will help you understand how a chat is carried out between a _User_ and the _System_. For example, there are only certain types of cousins that are accepted. You can find these types, either in the end of this notebook or under the file [cuisine_types.txt](./cuisine_types.txt).
