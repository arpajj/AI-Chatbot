#  AI-Chatbot project:

#### This is a small application regarding that recommends restaurants to potential customers using information retrieval by a standard small database (type of cuisines, areas etc). For operation (understanding & generation), the AI-Chatbot is based on logic, machine learning and hard-coded rules while processing the input utterances.   

## How to use:

__STEP 1__: Start by cloning the present repository by running: `git clone https://github.com/arpajj/AI-Chatbot.git`.

__STEP 2__: Install all the required packages from the [requirements file](./requirements.txt) by using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

__STEP 3__: If you are only interested to test/talk to the AI-Chatbot you can run the file [chatting.py](./chatting.py), by executing `python chatting.py`. If you do so, you will be asked if you want to chat with the "normal Chatbot" ([Chatbot.py](./Chatbot.py)) or with a "shortened version of the Chatbot" ([Short_Chatbot.py](./Short_Chatbot.py)).  

__STEP 4__: If you are also interested on the statistical analysis on the data that the project used, you can run the notebook [Runner.py](./Runner.ipunb). In the end of this notebook you will be able to start chatting with the two versions of the Chatbot (as in the [chatting.py](./chatting.py) file). 

### __Important Note__: âœ… _It's highly recommended_ that first you explore the original notebok of the project
